**Pronouns:** He/Him
**Location:** London
**Time Zone:** GMT

## How I work
* When I need to concentrate, I listen to music.
* I prefer to work individually, but I also love pairing!

## Times I work
* Outside of Project Fursona, I have full time 9-5 job on the weekdays.
* I am able to commit a minimum of 8 hours a week to this project.
* I tend to be sporadic when I work on this project, my personal life can sometimes be unexpected so I may not be able to commit to everything.
* When I do work on this project, it will usually be after 6PM GMT on weekdays and any time on weekends.

## How to communicate with me

* Feel free to reach out on Telegram!
* When we go live with Discord, I may not see all mentions of me in channels. If you need something from me and I haven't responded please DM me!
* If I am in a meeting, I tend to turn off any other communication tools so I can focus solely on that meeting.

## How I like to receive feedback

* I appreciate honesty and structured feedback. The best way to give me feedback is one-to-one, either in DM or on a call, using the [SBI Framework](https://medium.com/pm101/the-situation-behavior-impact-feedback-framework-e20ce52c9357)

## What's in my toolbelt

* If you pair with me, most likely I will be encouraging [Test-Driven-Development (TDD)](https://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-6-p1). I tend to follow classic TDD with red-green-refactor. There are many interpretations/misinterpretations of TDD but feel free to pair with me to see how I do it.
* [Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html) is very valuable. I love being able to tackle problems with a pair. Not only is it a great learning experience for myself, I hope it will also be valuable to you when we pair.
* My favourite langauge is TypeScript. I have long been a user of JavaScript, but I have fallen in love with the type system with TS. It removes a lot of guarding that I would normally need to do in JS.
* Serverless....
* Clean Code is a big +1 for me. I favour small and simple implementations over unecessarily complex.
* Some acronyms I like: Write Everything Twice (WET), Nike/Just F*cking Do it (JFDI)*

## Other things to consider

* I have Social Anxiety Disorder which means I can be quiet in meetings, or it can take a while for me to reply to messages.
